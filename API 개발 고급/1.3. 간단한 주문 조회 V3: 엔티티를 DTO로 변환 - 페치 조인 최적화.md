### 엔티티를 DTO로 변환 - 페치 조인 최적화

* 기존에서는 N+1 문제가 발생 , 해결법은?

order를 가져올때 member까지 객체 그래프를 한번에 가져오고 싶다


* OrderSimpleApiController.java - 내용 추가

```java

@GetMapping("/api/v3/simple-orders")
public List<SimpleOrderDto> ordersV3() {
    List<Order> orders = orderRepository.**findAllWithMemberDelivery()**;
    List<SimpleOrderDto> result = orders.stream()
        .map(o -> new SimpleOrderDto(o))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    return result;
}

```

* OrderRepository.java - 내용 추가

```java

public List<Order> findAllWithMemberDelivery() {
    return em.createQuery(
        "select o from Order o" +
        " join fetch o.member m" +
        " join fetch o.delivery d", Order.class
    ).getResultList();
}

```

order를 가져올때 member,delevery를 조인해서 한번에 가져오는 방식, 이 때는 LAZY도 무시하고 한번에 값을 채워 프록시가 아니라 진짜 값을 가져온다
> 이를 fetch.join이라고 한다


기존 Order 엔티티만을 조회하고 Member, Delivery 엔티티는 프록시 객체로 조회하는 경우와 다르게,

Order, Member, Delivery를 페치 조인을 사용해서 쿼리 1번에 조회할 수 있다.

* 결과

```java

select
        order0_.order_id as order_id1_6_0_,
        member1_.member_id as member_i1_4_1_,
        delivery2_.delivery_id as delivery1_2_2_,
        order0_.delivery_id as delivery4_6_0_,
        order0_.member_id as member_i5_6_0_,
        order0_.order_date as order_da2_6_0_,
        order0_.status as status3_6_0_,
        member1_.city as city2_4_1_,
        member1_.street as street3_4_1_,
        member1_.zipcode as zipcode4_4_1_,
        member1_.name as name5_4_1_,
        delivery2_.city as city2_2_2_,
        delivery2_.street as street3_2_2_,
        delivery2_.zipcode as zipcode4_2_2_,
        delivery2_.status as status5_2_2_ 
    from
        orders order0_ 
    inner join
        member member1_ 
            on order0_.member_id=member1_.member_id 
    inner join
        delivery delivery2_ 
            on order0_.delivery_id=delivery2_.delivery_id

```

이전과 다르게 쿼리가 한 번만 나간다!!

+) 페치 조인과 일반 조인의 차이

페치 조인이 아닌 그냥 join을 써도 되지 않을까?

-> 실제 sql 쿼리를 비교하면 왜 페치 조인을 써야 하는지 쉽게 알 수 있다.

* 페치 조인

```java
select
        order0_.order_id as order_id1_6_0_,
        member1_.member_id as member_i1_4_1_,
        delivery2_.delivery_id as delivery1_2_2_,
        order0_.delivery_id as delivery4_6_0_,
        order0_.member_id as member_i5_6_0_,
        order0_.order_date as order_da2_6_0_,
        order0_.status as status3_6_0_,
        member1_.city as city2_4_1_,
        member1_.street as street3_4_1_,
        member1_.zipcode as zipcode4_4_1_,
        member1_.name as name5_4_1_,
        delivery2_.city as city2_2_2_,
        delivery2_.street as street3_2_2_,
        delivery2_.zipcode as zipcode4_2_2_,
        delivery2_.status as status5_2_2_ 
    from
        orders order0_ 
    inner join
        member member1_ 
            on order0_.member_id=member1_.member_id 
    inner join
        delivery delivery2_ 
            on order0_.delivery_id=delivery2_.delivery_id

```

* 일반조인

```java

select
        order0_.order_id as order_id1_6_,
        order0_.delivery_id as delivery4_6_,
        order0_.member_id as member_i5_6_,
        order0_.order_date as order_da2_6_,
        order0_.status as status3_6_ 
    from
        orders order0_ 
    inner join
        member member1_ 
            on order0_.member_id=member1_.member_id 
    inner join
        delivery delivery2_ 
            on order0_.delivery_id=delivery2_.delivery_id

```

Order 엔티티의 필드만 조회한다 -> member.getName()과 같은 메서드 호출 시 추가 쿼리 나간다.(지연 로딩)
